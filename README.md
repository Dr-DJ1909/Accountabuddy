## About

AccountaBuddy is a mobile productivity app that allows users to input tasks and gives them a virtual pet whose status reflects whether the user has been completing them or not. Users are goaded into caring for their cute little pet by doing what they set out to do - or guilted into quickly doing things if they don't and let their pet die.

Below are how healthy and happy a user's pet are if they complete their exercise tasks at a good rate, versus if they do not and their pet suffers the consequences:
