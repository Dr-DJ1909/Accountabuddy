## About

AccountaBuddy is a mobile productivity app that allows users to input tasks while giving them a virtual pet whose status reflects whether the user has been completing them or not. Users are encouraged to care for their cute little pet by doing what they set out to do - or guilted into quickly doing things if they don't and let their pet die.

Below are how healthy and happy a user's pet is if they complete their exercise tasks at a good rate, versus if they do not and their pet suffers the consequences:

The pet's HP bar in the corresponding category reflects how well the user has been completing tasks.

As part of the `social` functionality, users can search for friends and send friend requests. Once accepted, they can compare their progress to their friends' by seeing their respective pets' interactions - the pet with more health will flex on the other. They can also see their achievement badges.
